    <h1>Work Done</h1>
    <h2>Python Glitch Art</h2>
    <p>
      The first project I independently worked on was a python module that
      would be able to make glitch art. I started working on it around
      mid-April of 2016. Here are some sample outputs. The module can be found
      in my github repos. It was made by making a wrapper class for the
      PIL module in python, and then it just required being creative as to what
      I wanted to do with each picture. It was honestly one of the most
      rewarding projects I've done.

    <h2>MobileProof Mobile Application</h2>
    <p>
      The most recent project I've worked on is an application called MobileProof
      which is supposed to implement a functional mobile form of the website
      proofwiki. I was working with my friend Madhav Kumar (@MadhavRKumar on
      Github), and I was solely responsible for all of the server side aspects
      of creating the app. This is because we didn't have the money to buy a
      dedicated server, so we turned an old Dell Inspiron into an Ubuntu 16.04
      server. From there, I used python network programming to make a threaded
      server that would be able to handle search requests. The app isn't finished
      yet, but here the logo which was designed by Madhav Kumar.

    <h2>Other/Mathematics Related</h2>
    <p>
      In the summer of 2015, I was invited to be apart of the Summer Institute
      in Biostatistics at Boston University. There, I was able to learn statistical
      methods relating to the field of biostatistics and bioinformatics. I was
      able to use actual data from the Farmingham study all while learning SAS
      and R. Since then, I've had a deep passion for the interconnectedness
      between computer science and mathematics.
